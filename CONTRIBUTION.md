  - Verified transitions ensure system integrity
  - Supports diverse user workflows within the welfare system
  - Enhanced flexibility for workers moving into employer roles

### 8. Input Validation
- **Description**: Comprehensive input validation implemented across system forms and data entry points
- **Coverage**:
  - Form field validation (required fields, data types, formats)
  - Business logic validation
  - Security checks against invalid or malicious inputs
  - Cross-field validation for dependent fields
  - Error messaging and user feedback
- **Impact**:
  - Improved data quality and consistency
  - Enhanced security against invalid data entry
  - Better user experience with clear validation feedback
  - Reduced backend processing errors
